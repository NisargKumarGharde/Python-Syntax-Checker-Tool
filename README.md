### Problem Statement 1
# *Python-Syntax-Checker-Tool*

This project focuses on creating a Python utility that reads the contents of .py file and checks for syntax errors using the built-in compile() function. It helps students detect mistakes in their code before execution.

### *Description:*

1. Accept the file path of a Python script from the user
2. Read the entire file content
3. Use the *compile()* function to validate the syntax
4. If a syntax error is detected, display the error message with the line number
5. If no errors are found, display a success message indicating the file is valid

### *Functional Components:*

1. File input through user prompt
2. Read and store script content using file handling
3. Validate syntax using *compile()*
4. Catch syntax errors using *try-except*
5. Dispaly result to the user with appropriate message
