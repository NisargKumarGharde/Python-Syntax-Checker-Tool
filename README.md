### Problem Statement 1
# *Python-Syntax-Checker-Tool*

This project focuses on creating a Python utility that reads the contents of .py file and checks for syntax errors using the built-in compile() function. It helps students detect mistakes in their code before execution.

*Part of my college IIT Patna tied up with GUVI(HCL) internship.

## Do this before running the program
Before opening my *.py* file in any IDE, disable any code assist (eg. GitHub Copilot, Gemini Code Assist, or other).

### *Description:*

1. Accept the file path of a Python script from the user
2. Read the entire file content
3. Use the *compile()* function to validate the syntax
4. If a syntax error is detected, display the error message with the line number
5. If no errors are found, display a success message indicating the file is valid

### *Functional Components:*

1. File input through user prompt
2. Read and store script content using file handling
3. Validate syntax using *compile()*
4. Catch syntax errors using *try-except*
5. Display result to the user with appropriate message

## *Note:*

1. Use IDE you prefer from the following: VS Code, Jupyter, Google Colab or JetBrains
2. Use Python code terminal if possible for better viewing of sample test syntaxes provided.
3. Use Python version (eg. Python 3.8 or more)
4. Read the commented part in the code, to avoid any confusion.

### *Also*
Sorry for any inconvenience if caused while reviewing the project.
